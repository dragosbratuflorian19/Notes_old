Pytorch packages:
 - torch: the top level packages
 - torch.nn: contains layers, weights...
 - torch.autograd: handles the derivative calculations
 - torch.nn.functional: loss functions/activation functions/convolution operations
 - torch.optim: optimization algorithms: SGD/Adam
 - torch.utils: datasets/dataloaders

 CUDA:
  - GPU are better than CPU if the computation can be done in paralel (CPUs can have 4/8/16 cores, comparing to GPUs which can have thousands of cores(higher GPUs have ))
  -
